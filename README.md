# emmekit.vba
One tool kit for reading manipulating and writting INRO EMME files

This tools were developed over the years working with EMME. They were originally in Fortran and I ported them to VBA so I could share with my coleagues... usually with strcit instructions and with me around.

The utilities include, among others:
- Import GPX files and compute observed speeds to the links
- Detour/cut/extend (some/all) lines to terminal or corridor (within a radius)
- Create integration fare terminals every first transit lines encounter 

So this is an attempt to bring VBA code to git and document it, working around the fact that Excel makes very hard to do it, by pasting the modules
